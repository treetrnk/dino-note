A simple command line writing application for jotting down notes or writing stories.

## How it Works

Run `dino-note.py` and begin typing.

When you're done, press `Ctrl+D` to automatically save your document to the current working directory. This allows you to build a folder structure exactly as you need it with existing command line tools. By default, Dino Note saves your file with the following format `[Date]-[Time]-[Word count]w-[Four most commonly used words].md`.

## Why?

Dino Note is a no frills note taking and writing application. It runs directly in the command line and doesn't require you to come up with a filename when you save it. It doesn't even let you edit more than a few of the previous words. This makes it great for note taking and idea capturing without anything getting in the way. But  it is also great for longer form writing.

Some common pieces of writing advice are to write every day, eliminate all distractions, and not to edit until you are done writing. Since Dino Note is so easy to launch, it takes away many of the barriers to actually sitting down and writing. Being based in the command line, there is also a lot less to distract you, like fonts, punctuation, alignment, etc. Dino Note also doesn't allow you to edit more than the current line of text, which keeps you focused on the writing instead.
